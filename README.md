Hi, welcome to

# Scrabble Workout in Vue!

Scrabble Workout in Vue is my previous app ([Scrabble Workout](https://github.com/scrabble-workout/scrabble-workout) - React & Redux) re-written in Vue and TypeScript.

Scrabble Workout is an app aiming to make you a Scrabble Master. Once you start a game you get a set of 7 tiles with letters. Your task is to form them into a 7-letter word within a given time. Some words have anagrams so more than one solution is possible.
